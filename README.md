# About

## This ERP project is comprised of two separate parts:

- backend: the server side, handling business logic, data storage, and APIs
- frontend: the client side (web UI) for interacting with the ERP features

### It organizes modules and features typical of ERP systems (e.g. users, roles, permissions, inventory, accounting, etc.). The separation allows independent development, testing, scaling, and deployment.

# Features

## Here are some sample features you may have (please adjust):
- User authentication & authorization
- Role-based access control
- CRUD operations for entities (products, customers, orders, etc.)
- Inventory management
- Sales / Purchase modules
- Reporting / dashboards
- RESTful API endpoints
- Responsive web interface
You can list all modules you implemented here.

# Architecture

- Backend: serves RESTful APIs, connects to a database, handles business logic
- Frontend: single-page application (SPA) or multi-page, communicates via API
- Separation of concerns: UI vs server logic
- Scalable & modular: easy to add or replace modules

# Prerequisites

## Make sure you have installed:

- [Node.js & npm / yarn]
- A database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Git
