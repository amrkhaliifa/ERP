t# TODO: Make Order Tab Client and Product Selectors Allow Typing for Fast Selection

## Plan Steps
- [x] Update frontend/index.html: Replace selects with input fields and add datalists for client and product.
- [x] Update frontend/js/app.js: Add global arrays for clients and products, modify load functions to populate datalists, update addItemBtn and orderForm submit handlers to use inputs and arrays.
- [x] Test typing and selection in order form.
- [x] Ensure form submission works with IDs.
- [x] Verify no breaking changes in other parts of the app.
